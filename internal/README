These files reflect a subset of the internal go/vgo code from
https://github.com/golang/vgo/tree/master/vendor/cmd/go/internal

They are copied and have imports modified to be referencable from
a separate project. Since 'internal' modules cannot be referenced
directly, this is the path of least resistance, but will require
manual pulls as changes are made upstream.
